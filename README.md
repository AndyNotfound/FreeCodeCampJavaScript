# Free Code Camp JavaScript Algorithm Excersise
This repository is dedicated for FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Courses.<br><br>
In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, I'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
<br><br>
Once I have the fundamentals down, I'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.
<br><br>
Along the way, I'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).
